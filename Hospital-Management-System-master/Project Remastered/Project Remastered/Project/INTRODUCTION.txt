OBJECTIVE:

This project is based on “ HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ” and in this project we have implemented the concepts of classes and objects. This project is capable of keeping
record of the doctors and the patients that have visited the hospital.
Hospital Management System provides the benefits of streamlined operations, enhanced administration & control, superior patient care, strict cost control and improved 
profitability. HMS is powerful, flexible, and easy to use and is designed and developed to deliver real conceivable benefits to hospitals.


PROJECT OVERVIEW:

The Hospital Management System (HMS) is designed for any Hospital to replace their existing manual, paper based system. The new system is to control the following 
information; patient information, room availability, staff and operating room schedules, and patient invoices. These services are to be provided in an efficient, cost
effective manner, with the goal of reducing the time and resources currently required for such tasks.

All of this information must be managed in an efficient and cost wise fashion so that an institution’s resources may be effectively utilized HMS will automate the 
management of the hospital making it more effective and error free. It aims at standardizing data, consolidating data ensuring data integrity and reducing 
inconsistencies.


A significant part of the operation of any hospital involves the management and timely retrieval of great volumes of information. This information typically involves
5 Main Classes and each Main Class consists of 3 Sub-Classes ;
